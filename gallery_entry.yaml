  Our project is an interactive pig-theme interpreter. It supports string handling,
  boolean expressions (such as and and or), and basic data evaluation. The interface
  is designed to be engaging and user-friendly, featuring a cute pig figure that 
  interacts with the user through pig-themed messages.
  
  Users can input strings or boolean expressions and the interpreter will evaluate 
  and respond accordinngly. The Pig Interpreter is intented to provide an enjoyable
  way to interact with fundamental programming concepts.
